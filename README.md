# RNN_Digit_Recognizer
An implementation of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using PyTorch for handwritten digit recognition on the MNIST dataset (Kaggle Digit Recognizer). The project demonstrates treating each image row as a time step for sequence modeling. Training incorporates best practices such as: learning rate scheduling, weight decay regularization, train/validation splits, and evaluation with accuracy/loss plots.
